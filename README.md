# pla [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mercadolibre/pla.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mercadolibre/pla)

Pla is a tiny program that sends some load to a web application. It's similar to Apache Bench ([ab](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html)), but with better availability across different platforms and a less troubling installation experience.

Pla is originally written by [rakyll](https://github.com/rakyll) and is available at [rakyll/boom](https://github.com/rakyll/boom).

Due to some issues like memory consumption I decided to fork it.

## Installation

Simple as it takes to type the following command:

    go get -u github.com/mercadolibre/pla

## Usage

Pla supports custom headers, request body and basic authentication. It runs provided number of requests in the provided concurrency level, and prints stats.
~~~
usage: pla [<flags>] <url>

Tiny and powerful HTTP load generator.

Flags:
  -h, --help                 Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).
  -n, --amount=0             Number of requests to run.
  -l, --length=0s            Length or duration of test, ex: 10s, 1m, 1h, etc. Invalidates n.
  -c, --concurrency=0        Concurrency, number of requests to run concurrently. If concurrency is set as 0 pla will run with the same amount of cores that the processor has.
                             Cannot be larger than n.
  -q, --qps=0                Rate Limit, in seconds (QPS).
  -m, --method="GET"         HTTP method.
  -H, --header=HEADER ...    Add custom HTTP header, name1:value1. Can be repeated for more headers.
  -t, --timeout=0s           Request timeout, ex: 10s, 1m, 1h, etc.
  -d, --body=""              Request Body.
  -a, --auth=""              Basic Authentication, username:password.
      --disable-compression  Disable compression.
      --disable-keepalive    Disable keep-alive.

Args:
  <url>  Request URL
